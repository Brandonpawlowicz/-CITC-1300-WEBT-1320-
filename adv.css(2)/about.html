        <h2>Does Batman work alone?</h2>
        <hr>
 <p>The character of Batman has always been portrayed as a solitary figure in his fight against crime. However, the introduction of Dick Grayson as Robin brought about a significant change. Robin became Batman's sidekick and marked the beginning of the Batman Family.

    Batman and Robin formed a strong partnership and worked together for many years. During the Golden Age, Batman even joined the GCPD, and Commissioner Gordon became part of the Batman Family. Initially, the team consisted of only Batman, Robin, and occasional collaborations with Linda Page, Bruce Wayne's love interest. Later on, Alfred Pennyworth, also known as "Alfred, the Butler," became an integral part of the Batman Family, providing unwavering support to the team.</p>&copy; All rights reserved

   <h3>Batman's Golden Age</h3>
 <p>Kane relinquished ownership of the character and in return, he received a mandatory byline on all Batman comics. Initially, his name was only written on the title page of each story, but it later disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s. In the late 1970s, Bob Kane was credited as the creator of Batman, along with other writers and artists receiving credits for their contributions. On the other hand, Finger did not receive the same recognition. Although he was acknowledged for his work on other DC projects, his contract did not grant him a byline for Batman. Finger's lack of major accomplishments and recognition in his career left him disheartened. Jerry Robinson, who worked with Finger and Kane, criticized Kane for not sharing the credit and acknowledging Finger's vital role in the creation of Batman. </p>

   <h3>Batman's silver Age</h3>
 <p>During the 1950s, Batman comics faced criticism and controversy due to psychologist Fredric Wertham's book, "Seduction of the Innocent." Wertham claimed that comic books, including Batman, influenced children to commit crimes and corrupted their morals. He specifically criticized Batman comics for alleged homosexual undertones, suggesting that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers. This led to public outcry and the establishment of the Comics Code Authority. To counter these allegations, new characters like Batwoman and Bat-Girl were introduced, and the stories took on a lighter, campier tone. Additionally, Batman stories started incorporating more science fiction elements to emulate the success of other DC characters.</p>

   <h3>Batman's modern Age</h3>
 <p>The Modern Age, in 1939 and batman's popularity soared in the following decades. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, DC editors became concerned that their entire line, which had been around for over twenty years, needed a fresh start. This led to the introduction of the multiverse concept, where the superheroes from the late 1950s were retconned into separate characters from their 1930s and 1940s counterparts. The Golden Age heroes of Earth-2 were the ones who had adventures in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, while the Silver Age Earth-1 became the main DCU versions.In the mid-1980s, DC decided to reboot again with Crisis on Infinite Earths, which not only revamped Batman but also merged multiple character universes into one, creating a new collective history known as "New Earth."</p>
